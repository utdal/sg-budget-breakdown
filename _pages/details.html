      >
      of the University of Texas System for approval, and following approval
      the operating budget is made publicly available on the UT Dallas
      Office of Budget and Finance website as a PDF. We manually converted
      the published budget to the necessary formats to conduct the
      calculations and transformations necessary to produce the following
      visualizations.

      this granular data for that fund category.
