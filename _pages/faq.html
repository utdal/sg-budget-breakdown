        First, it is important to note that all revenues listed in the operating budget are estimated.
        Operating budgets are plans for the future that are created far in advance and approved by various groups.
        Because students generally pay tuition prior to the university incurring the full costs for that semester, the
        university is receiving advance payment
        for its services. Parts of this advance payment are invested with
        <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline transition" href="https://www.utimco.org/">UTIMCO</a>, the University
        of Texas/Texas A&M Investment Management Company. This group then invests the money in short- and medium-term
        funds. The interest and capital gains from these investments are then used as reserve funds for unbudgeted,
        unforeseen expenses.

        Adjustments are an accounting representation used to remove duplication from the budget. A simple example are
        tuition discounts. The university pays for various
        scholarships. These scholarships are listed as expenses, and the tuition paid by the scholarship is listed as
        a revenue. Adjustments remove this duplication.

        All borrowing by the university is done in conjunction with the University of Texas System. University
        officials send their debt
        requests to the system, which must be approved by the <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline transition"
          href="https://www.utsystem.edu/offices/board-regents">Board of Regents</a>. The requests from all member
        institutions within the system are bundled to give the system improved bargaining power
        when obtaining the requested investments. The debt service payments on these loans are generally paid from
        reserve funds that are collected form
        yearly revenues.

        The donor of an endowment determines its intended purpose and sets limitations on its spending. Current
        endowments can be found at the
        <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline transition"
          href="https://development.utdallas.edu/support/endowments/current-endowments/">Office of Development and
          Alumni Relations website</a>. Generally, the prinicpal amount of the endowment is left invested, through
        UTIMCO, while
        earnings from the investment are utilized. In many cases, endowment balancing reinvests a small portion of the
        earnings to ensure the principal
        is resistant to the effects of inflation.

        In general, any service that is outside the core mission of the university&mdash;education for degree-seeking
        students&mdash;should be self-suppporting.
        This means that these services should bring in enough revenue to sustain their activities. This applies to
        dining, housing, and executive education.
