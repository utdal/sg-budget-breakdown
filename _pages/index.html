      This site is a product of a Student-Led University Budget Breakdown
      Taskforce formed by the UT Dallas Student Government. This group was
      formed to provide accessible and digestible information about the
      University&apos;s Budget and usage of student fees. You will find
      several visualizations that were generated using the University&apos;s
      Budget for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2023.

      occurring during the Fall 2022 Student Union Building Fee and
      Intercollegiate Athletics Fee Referendums revealed that students are
      both unaware and misinformed about the nature of university finances.
      The UT Dallas Student Government felt an obligation to inform itself
      and the broader student body. This task force seeks to create greater
      transparency for students and set a precedent for the Student
      Government as a source of information that better informs students.
      The process of reviewing, summarizing, and visualizing university
      financial data has allowed us to answer many questions and explore new
      topics that we wish to explore in the future.
