			The majority of the university's spending on instruction goes to the wages
			and salaries of faculty and staff. The school aims to fund as many of the
			salaries as possible using state appropriations. This is because if state
			funds are used to pay a salary, the state will also pay for the benefits.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The salary category in this chart also includes various salary reserves.
			To avoid layoffs when enrollment is low for a short period of time, the
			university keeps reserve funds to allow them to continue to pay employees.

		<p>
			University Housing is considered an auxiliary service. This means that it is considered to be
            outside of the core purpose of the university, educating degree-seeking students. In such,
            the university expects it to be self-funded. It should, however, not run a significant profit, given 
            the university is a not a for-profit business.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			University Housing at UTD provides three primary sources of housing:

		<p>
			University Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics are both considered an auxiliary services. 
            This means that they is considered to be outside of the core purpose of the university, educating degree-seeking students. 
            In such, the university expects auxiliary services to be self-funded, and in this case these services are funded by specific
            student fees.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			With the exception of the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University, every public university in Texas spends 
            more on intercollegiate athletics than they earn from ticket sales, sponsorships, and other forms of income. For more information on
            athletics at other Texas public universities, see 
            <a 
                href="https://college-sports.texastribune.org/"
                class="text-blue-600 hover:underline transition">
                Ballpark Figures
            </a> from the Texas Tribune. It is unclear whether the situtation is different for private schools since they are not required to 
            release this information.
		</p>
        <br />
		<p>
			The two fees that fund these services are a Recreation Fee ($65 per student per semester) and Intramural and Intercollegiate Athletics Fee (about $45 per student each semester).
            UTD has by far the lowest Intercollegiate Athletic Fee of any public university in Texas. For example, the University of Texas at Tyler
            charges students $7 per credit hour per student each semester, capped at the cost 15 hours ($105).
