			The majority of the university's spending on instruction goes to the wages
			and salaries of faculty and staff. The university aims to fund as many of

			benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
			The salary category in this chart also includes various salary reserves.
			To avoid layoffs when enrollment is low for a short period of time, the

		<p>
			University Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics are both considered an
			auxiliary services. This means that they is considered to be outside of
			the core purpose of the university, educating degree-seeking students. In
			such, the university expects auxiliary services to be self-funded, and in
			this case these services are funded by specific student fees.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			With the exception of the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M
			University, every public university in Texas spends more on
			intercollegiate athletics than they earn from ticket sales, sponsorships,
			and other forms of income. For more information on athletics at other
			Texas public universities, see
			<a
				href="https://college-sports.texastribune.org/"
				class="text-blue-600 hover:underline transition">
				Ballpark Figures
			</a>
			from the Texas Tribune. It is unclear whether the situtation is different
			for private schools since they are not required to release this
			information.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The two fees that fund these services are a Recreation Fee (~$65 per
			student per semester) and Intramural and Intercollegiate Athletics Fee
			(~$45 per student each semester). UTD has by far the lowest
			Intercollegiate Athletic Fee of any public university in Texas. For
			example, the University of Texas at Tyler charges students $7 per credit
			hour per student each semester, capped at the cost for 15 hours ($105).
