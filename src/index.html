          This site is a product of a Student-Led University Budget Breakdown
          Taskforce formed by the UT Dallas Student Government. This group was
          formed to provide accessible and digestible information about the
          University&apos;s Budget and usage of student fees. You will find
          several visualizations that were generated using the University&apos;s
          Budget for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2023.

          occurring during the Fall 2022 Student Union Building Fee and
          Intercollegiate Athletics Fee Referendums revealed that students are
          both unaware and misinformed about the nature of university finances.
          The UT Dallas Student Government felt an obligation to inform itself
          and the broader student body. This task force seeks to create greater
          transparency for students and set a precedent for the Student
          Government as a source of information that better informs students.
          The process of reviewing, summarizing, and visualizing university
          financial data has allowed us to answer many questions and explore new
          topics that we wish to explore in the future.

      Notable Observations from the Analyzing University Budget
    </h1>
    <p>
      The University Budget report published on the university&apos;
      <a href="https://finance.utdallas.edu/public-reports"
        >Office of Budget and Finance</a
      >
      is delivered in a PDF format that is difficult to export into clean data
      files. Thus, the visuals available in the full breakdown (hyperlink to
      visuals page) were composed using manual extraction and focus on
      big-picture aspects of the budget. In the future, we hope to have access
      more analysis-friendly data and answer questions at a more detailed level.

      fees may change over time. There are strict guidelines on how the
      university spends the funds generated by these fees. There are limitations
      on how other sources of funding may be spent on expenses related to these
      fees. Most notably, a restriction that involves state-appropriated funds
      perfectly illustrates these types of limitations. Under Article 7, Sec. 18
      of the

      funded by the Available University Fund, may not be used for buildings or
      other permanent improvements to be used for student housing,
      intercollegiate athletics, or auxiliary enterprises. This stringent and
      complex set of laws means that major investments and changes to university
      operations required planning and time to ensure compliance State and
      Federal Law. This process can take many months or even years. Which is
      likely to produce situations where a proposed investment or new initiative
      may be misaligned with a pressing issue of the day.
