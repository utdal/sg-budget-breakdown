          This site is a product of a Student-Led University Budget Breakdown
          Taskforce formed by the UT Dallas Student Government. This group was
          formed to provide accessible and digestible information about the
          University&apos;s Budget and usage of student fees. You will find
          several visualizations that were generated using the University&apos;s
          Budget for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2023.

          occurring during the Fall 2022 Student Union Building Fee and
          Intercollegiate Athletics Fee Referendums revealed that students are
          both unaware and misinformed about the nature of university finances.
          The UT Dallas Student Government felt an obligation to inform itself
          and the broader student body. This task force seeks to create greater
          transparency for students and set a precedent for the Student
          Government as a source of information that better informs students.
          The process of reviewing, summarizing, and visualizing university
          financial data has allowed us to answer many questions and explore new
          topics that we wish to explore in the future.

          These fees have multiple restrictions. There are limitations on how
          the fees may change over time. There are strict guidelines on how the
          university spends the funds generated by these fees. There are
          limitations on how other sources of funding may be spent on expenses
          related to these fees.
